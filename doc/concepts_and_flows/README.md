# Concepts and flows

Writing software usually starts with creating a simple program
to handle an use case. At this point, the solution practically
mirrors the problem. One way of distinguishing this state is 
that if I give you the problem you would arrive to a similar
solution without seeing mine.

However, if we want our solution to become more general, by
handling many use cases, the code we write cannot grow at
the same rate as our use cases. As a consequence we create
structures that can accommodate such diverse situations.

This solves the problem of generalization, but creates another:
Now a newcomer who has never seen the evolution from particular to
general use cases has a hard time seeing the justification for
the structures we have.

In this directory, you will find F# scripts that try to reproduce
those initial use cases, and at the same time they are linked
to current structures in the project.

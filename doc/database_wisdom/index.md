# Database Wisdom

This is a collection of problems you can face while designing a relational database.
The solutions to those problems are well known, but frequently they are taught backwards:
the theory is introduced without reference to the underlying problem that originated it.
This often happens in schools and causes some sort of alienation which the students cannot
handle effectively because they still don't have enough experience.

The solution to that alienation, which causes in the students a deep rejection of theory
in general, is to give them the chance of making the same conceptual jump the people
that originally devised the theory made.

If you are a student and you're suffering from _backwards teaching alienation_ my advice
is: vaccinate yourself against it before a teacher cripples your love for a subject.
The following exposition is a modest attempt in making such vaccine for the subject of
relational databases.
